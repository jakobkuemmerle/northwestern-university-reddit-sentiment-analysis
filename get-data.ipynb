I want to study Journalism and my dream goal is to write for CNN or possibly help produce specials. Northwestern University has from what I’ve seen, a very solid Journalism program but everywhere I look, all I see are these massive price points. My question is: is it worth it? Scholarships are a possibility as I’m second in my class with a 4.727 GPA. I plan on taking as many English and World AP Classes as reasonably possible. I have a loose tie to the school as my mom’s uncle is an alumni. An additional question I have would be: What classes or clubs would you recommend to show that I can participate around the school? It’s a fear of mine that my acedemics wont won’t be enough to be accepted. Finally, if Northwestern does not work out, what other universities would you recommend for someone like me?

      "Text: I’m a junior at Northwestern, and I’m quite frankly concerned with the direction that the university has taken. As I see that NU is gaining traction here quite rapidly (back when I was applying, NU hardly got a mention — now, I feel like it’s all over the place), and that it might be among *the* most talked about schools over at r/transferstudents, I felt like I needed to get this off my chest: Northwestern isn’t for everyone, and it’s not in an enviable state at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) COVID-19:\n",
      "\n",
      "Most peer schools (which I’ll define as elite private schools), amid COVID, made one of three choices — bring people back (with ample testing), don’t bring people back, or bring *some* people back. Duke and Cornell were quite successful doing the former. Princeton and Penn did the second of these three, giving ample notice to students and working with those in need. Schools doing the last of these options, like Yale and Dartmouth, generally introduced well-planned schemes to bring back 2 years in the spring, and 2 years in the fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Northwestern initially decided to go ahead and bring everyone back, only to cancel freshmen and sophomores *one week* before class began. On top of this, they did not reduce tuition for financial aid recipients like most peers did, but they *did* create a financial aid incentive for kids on aid to return to Evanston *anyway* and buy an apartment. Hence, we now have a large, hardly-tested mass of underclassmen off campus, and we’ve provided next to nothing for those who were screwed out of an in-person experience at the last minute. It’s not like there aren’t many cases *anyway* either — we’re right now in the “yellow” zone due to, mostly, a lack of testing and contact tracing. \n",
      "\n",
      "To add insult to injury, because of the way our campus works (we have housing for 50% of the student body, but that’s it), it’s looking like we will invite only the upperclassmen back *again* in the winter, screwing over underclassmen at the last minute *once more.* This is mostly because we just lack the capacity to test at an acceptable level — once a week at a Mail-away lab is all that the $10B endowment can muster. If you think that going to NU over another big ten school is great because they “care about the students,” think again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Recent Anger\n",
      "\n",
      "As many of you might have read in the news, there have been some pretty [intense ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-northwestern-protest-20201101-zrfm7ocmbnejribnahrfheotfi-story.html%3foutputType=amp) riots at Northwestern recently, and it’s all gone unmitigated by the university. From the Chicago Tribune:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The crowd marched into downtown Evanston, with some protesters throwing rocks and bricks at police officers, lighting fireworks in the direction of officers, pointing lasers at police officers’ eyes, and using umbrellas to cover individuals graffitiing streets, stop signs, and electric boxes, and damaging property,” the police statement said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This wasn’t even the first incident — weeks ago, the arch and administration buildings were vandalized with some violent graffiti (“more dead pigs”), and *riot* police were called in to quell the discontent. Regardless of your political beliefs, Northwestern has been a place of recent conflict, violence, and quite severe unrest. This is, no doubt, partially a spillover of the COVID-related anger at the president, but it really makes Northwestern a less pleasant place to be. There is an aura of rage that the university just cannot seem to control.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Financial struggles\n",
      "\n",
      "Northwestern’s endowment, once at $11.1B, has fallen [12%](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/06/14/campus/endowments-what-are-they-good-for/) over *ONE YEAR!* In fact, we’ve actually fired the person in charge of managing it, we’ve (controversially) laid off *hundreds* of workers, and all new construction or investment into the university seems to be on pause. This loss isn’t normal, even for 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "Northwestern has risen to its current level of prominence in large part because its had the financial resources to do so — we’ve used it to build a top football program, revamp our CS department, and continue to throw money at all programs until we became Ivy-level competitive. That stash has run out, and honestly, that’s concerning. It means not to expect anything new over the next few years — no new departments, buildings, renovated dorms, etc... It’s a time of austerity, with most of the building boom well over. At a school where acceptance rates have risen three years straight and national prestige has largely stagnated, I honestly don’t see much room to solidify NU’s reputation as an Ivy peer in the *short term*. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, NU is a great school, with many great programs, professors, and students. Just make sure you know what you’re getting into. The state of the union is...not great.\n",

I am also affiliated with Innovations for Poverty Action, who was our partner for data collection in Uganda for the research I am here to talk about.\n",

      " [short summary here](http://www.poverty-action.org/study/testing-effectiveness-payments-ecosystem-services-enhance-conservation-uganda), that evaluates a program in Uganda that paid individuals to keep their forest intact. Most of the forest is owned by poor farmers who have been cutting trees to sell to timber or charcoal dealers as an extra source of income, or to use the cleared land for growing crops. As a result, the forest is disappearing at one of the fastest rates seen anywhere in the world. The Ugandan government wanted to protect the forest to save chimpanzees and other endangered species, whose habitat is dwindling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preserving forests has another big benefit for all of us: It keeps CO2 out of the atmosphere. Trees naturally absorb and sequester CO2 from the atmosphere as part of photosynthesis.  The carbon they are storing is emitted into the atmosphere when they are burned or decompose. Paying forest owners to keep their forests intact is thus one way we can reduce global CO2 emissions.  Furthermore, offering a payment and making the program voluntary means that, unlike under a ban, we are not making poor people worse off. This approach (called “Payments for Ecosystem Services” or PES) has been used in Costa Rica and elsewhere, but there has been a lot of skepticism about whether it actually works (for reasons I’m happy to discuss).\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to rigorously test how well PES works using a randomized trial; some villages got the program, and some didn’t. A Ugandan conservation non-profit called [CSWCT](http://www.ngambaisland.org/pes-project) ran the program, and we evaluated the program’s impacts. We compared the amount of deforestation in villages with the program (treatment group) to the ones without it (control group) using satellite imagery.  This is the first time PES has been tested with the randomized controlled trial method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom-line finding: The program saved a lot of forest. We converted that gain in forest into a quantitative dollar benefit to the world from the delayed CO2 emissions (I’m happy to explain more about how we did that). The climate-change benefits were more than twice the program costs. Our findings don’t mean PES will work always and everywhere, but they should make us more bullish on it. IMO, rich countries should be upping their funding for programs that pay people in poor countries to preserve forests. We need to reduce CO2 emissions, and this seems like a bargain way to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study was widely covered, [including by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/climate/a-cheap-fix-for-climate-change-pay-people-not-to-chop-down-trees-uganda.html), [the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/07/paying-people-to-preserve-their-trees/534351/), [InsideClimateNews](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20072017/stopping-deforestation-payment-ecosystem-services-trees-uganda-climate-change), and [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/uganda-deforestation-pay).

When we started this work, young men were able to bank sperm before a potentially sterilizing cancer treatment but women, with the same hope for survival, were not provide options. Now we have options and babies born to men and women who have survived their disease. This work was fostered by my interest in ovarian biology. Men make sperm constantly – about 1,500 sperm with every heartbeat. By contrast, women are born with all the oocytes that we will ever have – about 1 million in our ovaries. My lab is interested in how the ovarian reserve, this million follicle pool (a follicle is a single egg surrounded by cells that produce hormones like estrogen and support egg maturation) is metered out from birth until menopause – 6 decades to wait for activation. We began growing individual ovarian follicles in our lab to unravel some of this fundamental biology and developed strategies that are helping cancer patients who want to protect their fertility.\n",

      "Modern libertarianism began with Friedrich Hayek’s admirable corrective to the Depression-era vogue for central economic planning. It resisted oppressive state power. It showed how capitalism could improve life for everyone. Yet today, it's a toxic blend of anarchism, disdain for the weak, and rationalization for environmental catastrophe. Libertarians today accept new, radical arguments―which crumble under scrutiny―that justify dishonest business practices and vaccine resistance in the name of “freedom.”\n",

      "Text: *From the /r/AskHistorians mod team*:\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple histories of US police violence against the Black community are being written this week. They’ve taken the form of tweet threads, news articles, blog posts, and conversations among friends, loved ones, and even strangers on the internet. Amidst these waves of information, we as historians want our readers to remember the following: \n",
      "\n",
      "Police brutality against Black people is woven into the fabric of the history of policing in the US—and reflects the historical reality that white America benefits from police and state violence against the Black community. George Floyd’s murder and the brutal suppression of the ensuing protests are the latest in a long history of police brutality and excessive, extraordinary violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "As historians like Edward Ayers and Sam Mitrani have established, the construct of American policing was formed between roughly 1840-1880 on the crest of two trends. First, rising population density in cities brought middle-class and wealthy white Americans into close contact with people they considered disruptive to their orderly world: sex workers, impoverished drunk people, Black residents, immigrants. Second, a spiralling urban trend towards wage labor for larger corporations that was itself a disruption in some of the institutions that had previously guarded local order, like families and close-knit neighborhoods.\n",
      "\n",
      "From their establishment in the mid- to late-19th century, American police forces have depended on their mandate to keep or restore the white, wealthy ideal of order and the active support or tacit acceptance of this ongoing role by the majority of white Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of lynching demonstrates this point with sickening clarity and is one we all should know. To highlight just one incident from the thousands that occured: a mob of white people dragged prosperous Black farmer Anthony Crawford from the Abbeville, South Carolina jail in full sight of the jailer and local sheriff on October 21, 1916. Crawford had been beaten and stabbed earlier that day; he was beaten again, possibly to death, hanged, and shot multiple times. His heinous crime? He accused a white man of trying to cheat him financially, and defended himself when a group of white men attacked him in response.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Hammond Moore has offered that one motivation for the lynching was a rumor the sheriff was going to help Crawford escape and the white murderers believed the police presence was not doing its job of keeping order according to their definition of “order.” However, when the sheriff and jailer looked the other way, they delegated their role of keeping order to the mob, empowering them to act on their behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Crawford’s case, it is easy to connect the dots between white people affording police the responsibility to keep order, white people benefiting from white supremacy, and state participation in unjust violence, not least because of the direct involvement of white civilians. We can easily see Crawford’s lynching as part of an broader phenomenon, not just an individual, extraordinary event. In effect, the police did - and kept doing - what white people wanted. A decade later, the Illinois Crime Survey highlighted:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The wildly disproportionate rate at which Black suspects were killed by Chicago police officers in comparison to the percentage of Black residents in the city\n",
      "* That a suspect or criminal (of any race) is “a product of his surroundings in the slum areas in the same way in which the good citizen is a product of the lake front environment.” [[PDF](https://homicide.northwestern.edu/docs_fk/homicide/ICS/ICS.28.pdf)]\n",
      "\n",
      "By the 1920s, research pioneered by women scholars at the University of Chicago was already highlighting how stereotypes around “slum environment” turned residents into perceived criminals. They observed that the Black neighborhoods defined as \"slums\" exhibited precisely the same \"disorderly\" characteristics that had spurred the creation of official police departments in the previous century. And they observed how these conditions were the result of pervasive, systemic white supremacy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, social workers documented how school segregation and the massive underfunding of Black schools by city politicians contributed to those same conditions, creating a feedback loop; The disorder the police were approved to combat was created by the lack of funding and resources. The ideal of order that the majority of white Chicagoans found attractive, in other words, both justified and resulted from police violence against their Black neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nature of a survey, like the Illinois Crime Survey, demonstrates the same thing we recognize in lynching: individual cases of state violence against Black Americans, whatever the specific circumstances, are part of a pattern. But while the specter of lynching haunts the fringes of American crime, the pattern of police brutality against the Black community has not let up. In 2015, Jamil Smith showed how the final moments of some many of those killed by police across the decades echoed each other, again and again. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the Fugitive Slave Act to George Floyd, examples of police violence against Black Americans are endless, gruesome, and there for everyone to see and behold. In 1942, Private Thomas Foster was beaten and shot four times by Little Rock police officers after intervening to stop the assault of a fellow soldier. In 1967, a cab driver named John William Smith was savagely beaten by the Newark police. In 1984, New York City police officers shot Eleanor Bumpurs multiple times as they tried to evict her, making the call that getting her out of her apartment was more important than accommodating her mental health struggles. We could list hundreds, if not thousands, further such examples that illustrate this pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s not enough to say, “here are a bunch of examples of police officers brutalizing Black people.” The ability of individual officers to assault and kill Black Americans year after year, decade after decade, murder after murder, stems from the unwillingness of the white majority to step beyond protesting individual cases or do to more than stroke our chins and say, “Yes, I see a pattern.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That pattern exists because despite every act of police brutality, and even despite protests following individual acts, white America’s preference for an \"orderly\" society has been a higher priority. From the inception of official police forces in the mid-19th century, to school truancy officers and border patrol, the American police have existed at the will of the white majority to keep and restore order, as defined by the white majority, using the \"necessary\" force, as defined by the mostly white police force and legal system.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we come to write the history of the last few days, we need to remember this wider context and that it goes beyond any single member of the police.  It is not that every officer is evil, but they do operate in a system which was designed to build and maintain white supremacy. Justice for the individual Black Americans killed by individual members of the police is necessary, but so is a long, hard look at - and action against - our understanding of societal order and how it must be upheld. \n",
      "\n",
      "Exposing these structures has taken years of untold work and sacrifice on the part of Black communities, activists and historians. It is far past time that white Americans help rather than hinder this work.\n",

      "Text: An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \"aerial\" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.\n",

      "THE. OHIO. STATE. UNIVERSITY. COMES IN AT #2. And with that, we have confirmation as to who’s #1. Ohio State more than deserves the top 2, finishing as the top team in the Big Ten and #2 overall over the last 40 years with a staggering 394-103-5 (.790 win %) record. What’s even crazier is that they’re 297-65-3 (.818 win %) over the last 29 years, averaging just 2 losses a season for nearly 3 decades. They’ve won at least 6 games in 39 out of their 40 seasons, and won 8+ games in 33 out of 39 non-covid seasons, which compared to the worst team on the list to play 40 seasons (#130 New Mexico State), the Aggies have 0 seasons of 8+ wins in 39 years. Ohio State has a VERY strong case to be #1 on this list, but ultimately what dropped them to #2 was the lack of national titles. Continuing this trend of drooling over stats, Ohio State has 19 seasons of 11+ wins over the last 29 years…just unreal what they’ve accomplished under Urban Meyer, Jim Tressel, Ryan Day, and yes, John Cooper.\n",

      "If you just listened to Ohio State fans talk about coach John Cooper, you’d expect this to be his best season. All jokes aside, it was rough sledding for Cooper in his first year with the Buckeyes, inheriting a 6-4-1 team from Earle Bruce that had also lost 8 starters to the NFL. Ohio State was hit or miss all throughout the year, usually missing rather than hitting. An opening 26-9 win came over Dick MacPherson’s Syracuse team, which was coming off a #4 11-0-1 season and would finish #13 10-2 with 1 of their 2 losses to the Buckeyes. Followed up by…a 10-42 beating at the hands of Pitt, who had just 1 winning season the previous 4 years. Followed up by…a 36-33 win over #7 LSU in which Ohio State scored 16 straight points in the last 4 minutes. Followed up by…a 7-41 loss to Indiana, arguably the most embarrassing loss in Ohio State history. You get the idea. Ohio State finished the year 4-6-1, culminating in a 31-34 loss to #12 Michigan in The Game. Cooper would go on to finish 111-43-4 in 13 years with OSU, but his legacy is marred by a 2-10-1 record against Michigan and a 3-8 record in bowl games.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cooper was now in his 9th season as head coach at OSU. LB Andy Katzenmoyer made headlines in week 1 by becoming the first true freshman to ever start at LB for Ohio State, as OSU trumped the Owls 70-7. Katzenmoyer would help lead one of the best defenses in the country, holding teams to 7.5 PPG in their first 4, beating #5 Notre Dame 29-16 and #4 Penn State 38-7. In just a month, Ohio State had moved up from #10 to #2. They kept winning, and really took off at the start of November, beating Minnesota 45-0 and Illinois 48-0 to improve to 9-0. Heading into The Game at 10-0 and #2, Ohio State was on the verge of a possible national title. The Buckeyes went up 9-0 by halftime against #21 Michigan, at home, but Michigan would score 13 unanswered points in the 2nd half to win 13-9 in one of the most painful losses of the series for Ohio State. They fell to #4, and beat #2 Arizona State in the Rose Bowl. The next day, #1 Florida State would lose to #3 Florida in the Sugar Bowl, meaning Ohio State missed out on a national title with the loss to Michigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Buckeyes finished #2, their highest finish since 1973. QBs Stanley Jackson and Joe Germaine combined for 24 TD 9 INT, and RB Pepe Pearson ran for nearly 1400 yards with 17 TD. It certainly helped to have legendary OT Orlando Pace, who was so dominant that the term “pancake block” exploded in popularity due to his tendency to put the opposing defensive lineman on their ass and lay on top of them, platonically. Pace finished 4th in Heisman voting, was the Big Ten Offensive POTY, was the #1 overall pick in the 1997 NFL Draft, and was selected to Sports Illustrated’s NCAA All-Century Team for the 1900s as one of the starting OTs. On defense, Katzenmoyer was a 2nd Team All-American, and DE and future Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel was also a 2nd Team All-American, allowing just 10.9 PPG.\n",

      "This was JT Barrett’s 298,354,282th season at Ohio State. Please clap. Reddit humor aside, this actually was Barrett’s 4th and final season, and amazingly he really did only play 4 seasons. Unfortunately this team is known for 2 embarrassing losses, because outside of them, this team was extremely good. The season opened with a 1-1 record thanks to a home loss to #5 Oklahoma at home, punctuated with a midfield flag plant by Baker Mayfield. Ohio State dropped from #2 to #8, but won the next 5 games by an average of 53-11. Now they had their chance to get back into playoff contention—hosting #2 Penn State in front of ESPN College GameDay, Penn State jumped out to a 21-3 lead, but JT Barrett played the game of his life, completing 33 of 39 passes for 328 yards with 4 TD 0 INT and 17 carries for 95 yards, leading Ohio State to a 39-38 comeback win. But again, the subsequent 24-55 loss to Iowa dominated the headlines, as it should’ve, with Barrett throwing 4 INTs with 3 of them to Iowa All-American CB Joshua Jackson. If not for that loss, Ohio State may have won the national title with the way they played down the stretch. A 5-0 finish included a 48-3 win over #12 Michigan State, win over 8-3 Michigan, 27-21 win over #4 Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship, and 24-7 over #8 USC in the Cotton Bowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ohio State finished #5 in the AP Poll, but #3 in my rankings for beating 13-1 Wisconsin, 11-3 USC, 11-2 Penn State, and 10-3 Michigan State, including some extras like 10-3 Army. JT Barrett finished his career 1st in Big Ten history in yards (12,697) and TDs (147), throwing for 3000 yards with 35 TD 9 INT and 800 rushing yards with 12 TD. He was also 1st Team All-Big Ten his 3rd time. Freshman RB JK Dobbins burst onto the scene with 1400 rushing yards and 7 TD on 7.2 YPC, taking the starting role of former 1000 yard rusher Mike Weber, who added 626 and 10 TD. C Billy Price was a consensus All-American and won the Rimington Award. On the defense, DE Nick Bosa was 1st Team All-American with 8.5 sacks and 7.5 TFL, and CB Denzel Ward was a consensus All-American with 15 PBU and 2 INT. It feels weird to say, but this ends up as Urban Meyer’s 2nd best team at Ohio State.\n",

      "First they started 0-0 and nobody really thought they’d win the national title. Then they were 7-0 and nobody really thought they’d win the title. Then 13-0 and nobody thought they’d win the title. They finished 14-0 and some STILL don’t think they won the title. 2002 Ohio State was a masterclass in Tresselball, named after coach Jim Tressel’s style of coaching which involved playing great defense and working field position, scoring just enough points to win. A 3-0 start had some quality wins like 45-21 over Texas Tech and 25-7 over #10 Washington State, but 3 more wins to get to 6-0 included just a 23-19 win over Cincinnati and 27-16 win over eventual 3-9 Northwestern. After a win over Wisconsin, Ohio State was 8-0 but still only #6 in the rankings, which would be unthinkable for Ohio State today. 2 straight wins over #17 Penn State and #23 Minnesota put them in control of their national title destiny, now #2 with just 3 games remaining. Tresselball was in full effect, needing the “HOLY BUCKEYE” TD pass on 4th and 1 to beat Purdue 10-6, and beating Illinois 23-16 in OT. #2 Ohio State hosted #9 Michigan for a chance to play in the national title, some chewing off their fingernails with memories of 1996. In a VERY exciting game, Ohio State led just 14-9 and Michigan got down to the OSU 25 with 1 play left, but Ohio State intercepted John Navarre’s pass at the goal line to seal a Big Ten title and National Championship appearance for the Buckeyes. #1 Miami (FL) entered as the defending champions and were rocking a 34 game win streak, still the longest in modern college football history to this day. As you’d expect, they were 11.5 point favorites, and most didn’t give Ohio State much of a chance. A legendary Buckeye performance produced so many iconic plays, perhaps most notably Maurice Clarett’s strip-fumble recovery of Miami’s Sean Taylor, right after OSU QB Craig Krenzel threw an interception. In a controversial overtime ending, Ohio State got an automatic first down on a 4th down pass interference call on Miami, ultimately winning the game 31-24 in OT for Ohio State’s first national title since 1970.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure if you noticed, but the 24 points scored by Miami was the most Ohio State gave up all season. This defense was very very good. LB Matt Wilhelm and S Mike Doss were consensus All-Americans, leading a defense that allowed 13.1 PPG and held opponents to 17 points or less 11 times, including 10 points or less 6 times. Special teams was fantastic as well, K Mike Nugent earning consensus All-American by hitting 25 of 28 FGs, and P Andy Groom was an All-American, averaging 45.0 yards per punt. On offense, freshman RB Maurice Clarett played just 1 year in college, rushing for 1237 yards with 16 TD. QB Craig Krenzel is one of the most unheralded national title-winning QBs ever, throwing for 2110 yards with 12 TD 7 INT and 350 rushing yards with 3 TD. In just his 2nd year at Ohio State, Jim Tressel had led the Buckeyes to a national title, and won a bunch of National Coach of the Year awards.\n",

      "I seriously think people forget just how ridiculous this team was. They were #1 ahead of 2019 LSU late in the season, even though you could set your watch to LSU beating a top 10 team every week. A subtle non-conference schedule included a 45-21 win over 11-3 C-USA champion FAU, 42-0 win over 11-3 AAC runner-up #21 Cincinnati, and 76-5 win over 8-6 MAC champion Miami (OH). Actual Big Ten play was…not even remotely close. Ohio State gave up on scoring after going up 51-10 on Indiana by the end of the 3rd. ESPN College GameDay attended 4-0 Ohio State at 3-1 Nebraska, but Ohio State held a 48-0 lead with 19 minutes left. Even a 34-10 win over #25 Michigan State, which was a “down game” for Ohio State, saw the Bucks outgain Michigan State by nearly 250 yards. #13 Wisconsin was supposed to do something with 3-time All-American and NFL All-Pro RB Jonathan Taylor, but all he could muster was 20 carries for 52 yards in a 38-7 Ohio State win. Do we even need to go over Maryland and Rutgers? Combined 129-35 score wins. #8 Penn State put up a good fight in a 28-17 Buckeye win, but it wasn’t as close as the score suggested, as Ohio State outgained another team by ~200 yards yet again, and Heisman contender DE Chase Young had 3 sacks. The offense danced on Michigan so badly in a 56-27 win that Michigan’s defense dropped from 268 YPG allowed to 294 YPG allowed. Even after #8 Wisconsin threw the kitchen sink at #1 Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game for a 21-7 lead, OSU laughed and said that’s cute, here’s a 27-0 2nd half shutout. They won the Big Ten title 34-21. In the Playoff Semifinal against #3 Clemson, Ohio State took a 16-0 lead in the 2nd quarter, but chunk plays from Clemson, a controversial no-fumble call from the refs, and Trevor Lawrence heroics got Clemson a 29-23 win in the end.\n",

QB Justin Fields had one of the best statistical seasons ever, throwing for 3273 yards with 41 TD 3 INT and 10 rushing TDs, only finishing 3rd in Heisman voting because of Joe Burrow and having to split votes with teammate Chase Young. Young, a star DE, was a consensus All-American and won the Big Defensive POTY, Nagurski, Bednarik, and Hendricks awards, also finishing with the 2nd most first-place votes in Heisman voting. OG Wyatt Davis and CB Jeffrey Okudah were consensus All-Americans as well. Junior RB JK Dobbins was a 1st Team All-American, getting 2250 yards and 23 TD from scrimmage.\n",

      "The one time everyone (excluding Michigan fans) were rooting for Ohio State. They had somehow taken the “underdog” role in 2014, mostly due to the loss of All-American QB Braxton Miller in the preseason, and an early season home loss to Virginia Tech, dropping them to #22 in the rankings at 1-1. Backup QB JT Barrett settled into more of a rhythm, winning 4 straight, then beating Penn State 31-24 on the road in 2OT thanks to a 2.5 sack game from DE Joey Bosa. 7-1 Ohio State was still underrated in the media, ranked #14 while 7-1 Michigan State was the Big Ten favorite at #8. The two met in East Lansing for College GameDay, and Ohio State came up huge in a 49-37 win, thanks to 386 yards and 5 TD from JT Barrett and 154 rush yards and 2 TD from RB Ezekiel Elliott. Focused on winning a Big Ten title, OSU held off a late surge from #25 Minnesota to win 31-24, beat Indiana, then pulled away late against Michigan for an 11-1 regular season. Just one little problem: JT Barrett went out with a season-ending injury against Michigan, and Ohio State was now down to 3rd string QB Cardale Jones. #5 Ohio State entered the Big Ten Championship on the outside looking in for the Playoff, with everyone expecting Alabama, Oregon, Florida State, and TCU to make it. If Ohio State just beat #13 Wisconsin, it wouldn’t be enough. So…they beat them 59-0. Zeke Elliott ran for 220 yards and Cardale Jones had a 255.8 passer rating on 17 attempts in his first ever start. Ohio State snuck into the Playoff at #4 to the surprise of many, and everyone thought Nick Saban would make quick work of a team down to their 3rd string QB. Well, Cardale did enough, and Zeke ran 85 yards through the heart of the south to ice the game, winning 42-35 over #1 Alabama in the semifinal. In the National Championship, Zeke won MVP with 246 rushing yards and 4 TD in a 42-20 win over #2 Oregon, winning OSU’s first national title since 2002.

Ezekiel Elliott rushed for 1878 yards and 18 TD on 6.9 YPC, and would’ve won the Doak Walker Award just about any other year. WR Devin Smith was the ultimate deep threat, only catching 33 passes but for 931 yards and 12 TD. Future NFL All-Pro WR Michael Thomas added 800 yards and 9 TD.

      "Text: I recently read an article on what lawyers are [expecting for higher education from a 2nd Trump admin](https://www.law360.com/articles/2263023/what-higher-education-can-expect-from-a-2nd-trump-admin). However, I think it applies pretty broadly to all education in the US. The article is paywalled, so I'll summarize here with some of my own thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DEI**\n",
      "\n",
      "The most visible plank in the Trump/Project 2025 platform as it applies to education is destroying the US Department of Education. I've given my summary of what that [might look like here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1gnfa8z/comment/lwaeqiz/) (INAL, but I follow politics pretty closely on certain issues).\n",
      "\n",
      "This article mostly focuses on one aspect of the DoED's mission which is to monitor and enforce access to education and prohibiting discrimination. To the right, this is effectively DEI and thus a target for their culture wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even outside abolishing the DoED to weaken minority protections, the article expects Republicans to vigorously go after schools based on the 2023 SCOTUS case [Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Fair_Admissions_v._Harvard). If you're not familiar, this SCOTUS case decided that considering race as part of admissions violated the Equal Protection Claus of the 14th amendment - effectively overturning previous SCOTUS decisions which determined that considering race was acceptable in certain circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the article says, we should expect Republicans to aggressively target schools under this ruling. Adding a bit of my own expectations here, I expect they won't be successful in winning many cases. But that's not really the point for them. Rather, Republicans will likely bring suit against schools that they don't like in order to entangle them in expensive lawsuits and drain them of funds - all at taxpayer expense. Missouri's current Attorney's General, Andrew Bailey, has been [especially pernicious with this](https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/education/missouri-attorney-general-accuses-schools-of-religious-and-race-based-discrimination/63-39bfc798-a067-445f-993f-960f14b79b2e).\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, schools have been able to interpret the SCOTUS ruling quite narrowly as it only applied to admissions. Schools are still able to consider race in other respects, such as financial aid. However, the article predicts that Republicans will be bringing a wave of lawsuits targeting this as well. And they are almost certain to be successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Funding**\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps one of the most important things the article says to expect is cuts to federal funding. One of the ways this may play out is by targeting endowment funds of universities. Trump's administration is going to face a very early challenge because they are proposing unrealistic tax cuts that need to be paid for. Thus, the article expects that Republicans could simply try to increase taxes on these funds to make up for tax cuts elsewhere. The article suggests this is likely as Trump has explicitly stated he wants to use this as a weapon against schools with DEI initiatives. His VP authored a 2023 bill that would increase the taxes on endowments from the current 1.4% to 35% on private colleges and universities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has also threatened to weaponize the DOJ to go after the tax-exempt status of organizations he disagrees with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding my own commentary: The shuttering of the DoED will also have some impacts to funding. Schools do receive some funding from the federal government. But I think one of the more pernicious impacts is that the DoED will no longer be able to oversee student loans. I haven't seen an explicit plan for this, but my expectation is that this means selling off current loans to private loan companies like MOHELA. This will likely give a massive cash infusion that Trump will be able to tout in the short term, but deprive the government from the long term income in the future, thereby setting the country up for another financial crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Campus Protests**\n",
      "\n",
      "The next major thing the article says to expect is increased scrutiny on campus protests - largely related to alleged antisemitism. From what I've seen, antisemitism is a *serious* problem\\* associated with protests related to Israel/Palestine. However, Republicans will likely be using this as a way to target liberal students with a broad brush, as well as foreign students attending US universities and chill free speech. Trump has [called for deporting students participating in such protests](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4993239-student-protesters-palestinians-israel-gaza-trump-crackdown/); something [also called for by his new pick for Attorney General](https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-ag-pick-pam-bondi-once-called-for-deporting-student-protesters/), Pam Bondi.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Title IX**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration added sexual orientation and sexual orientation to the protected classes under Title IX this year, which was consistent with the SCOTUS's ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County. Trump has promised to reverse such protections so Republicans will likely try to remove this, but it's not clear how successful they will be. What I suspect is more likely is that we will simply find the DOJ too busy with suing schools for alleged DEI programs to be available to help students protected under this expansion, making it much harder to hold schools that discriminate accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also expects we'll see a rollback in other Title IX protections regarding sexual misconduct investigations. Previously, Title IX required that hearings be held in a venue where all parties could be present, thus continuing to give the perpetrator access to their victims which makes victims less likely to report and pursue charges. This was recently reversed, but the article expects that this will be reinstituted. Similarly, there was a recent ban on having a single investigator, which will likely also be targeted.\n",

      "However, that was not the primary point of including this segment.

I’m Chris Voss, the founder and CEO of [The Black Swan Group](http://blackswanltd.com/), a consulting firm that provides training and advises Fortune 500 companies through complex negotiations. Rooted in hostage negotiation, my methodology centers around “Black Swans” small pieces of information that have a huge effect on an outcome. I currently teach at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business and Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.  I’ve also lectured at other schools including Harvard Law School the MIT Sloan School of Management, and Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

Just this week I released a book called [Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended-ebook/dp/B014DUR7L2), where I distill the skills I've gathered over my career into usable tips that will give the reader the competitive edge in any discussion—whether in the boardroom, at the dinner table, or at the car dealership.\n",

      "Everything we’ve previously been taught about negotiation is wrong:  you are not rational; there is no such thing as ‘fair’; compromise is the worst thing you can do; the real art of negotiation lies in mastering the intricacies of No, not Yes.   These surprising ideas—which radically diverge from conventional negotiating strategy—weren’t cooked up in a classroom, but are the field-tested rules FBI agents use to talk criminals and hostage-takers around the world into (or out of) just about any imaginable scenario.\n",

I'm looking for a real, high quality, elite-almost transfer admission help. A lot of them online seem to be very sketchy so if anyone has any reqs please let me know, I am not opposed to any high priced companies and/or individuals. I need the company or individual to be confident with their help they can help me transfer, someone that can help with all the steps in the admission process. Thank you!\n",

The first one was a Black Muslim espousing a syncretism between Islam and therapy culture (\"mindfulness\"). For example, he informed the crowd that \"hurt people hurt people,\" hence the behavior of the Israelis. Most notably to me, though, he made the claim that the term \"*pagan*\" is just a way of otherizing marginalized religious identities, as if Islam in particular wasn't founded on the defeat of the Arab pagans of Mecca and doesn't hold itself to be the only legitimate faith! Still, he finished his somewhat heretical speech with \"Takbirs,\" to which someone answered \"Allahu Akbar\" from the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second speaker was a woman who informed the crowd that she would \"hold space\" for people's emotions or something and repeatedly stressed the importance of everybody's \"safety\" (an oft-abused term in this context, but not altogether irrelevant given the looming threat of police action and arrest). Her priority and the priority of the organizers in general seems to be to appease the leaders of the university on certain matters, while remaining steadfast against the no-tent and no-bullhorn/speaker policy since abiding by it would render the protest ineffectual as a whole.\n",

      "Anyway, I got the sense from this experience that zoomers are coming together in a sort of ancestral impulse to espouse religiosity and feel communal belonging just like the hippies of old. There's no doubt that the Palestinian cause is just, but the way it manifests on an American college campus exposes contradictions specific to American society: bleeding-heart, liberal Jews who don't really exist in Israel demanding peace with Palestine, Muslims from the African American community who seem to be forming their own branch of Islam which has a unique sensitivity to bourgeois cosmopolitanism, all paired with anti-police anarchists who are just itching for a fight.\n",

      "\n",
      "And I just gotta say, even for a show like 30 Rock that’s big on absurdist humor and suspension of disbelief, that’s kinda hard to believe. Outside of Kenneth, all these characters are people whom, for the most part, you could imagine the things that they go through reasonably happening in real life. Yeah, it’s a stretch that Jenna’s church group was eaten by a bear or that she was educated on a boat, but theoretically those things *could* happen in real life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more to the point, I have a hard time believing that she’d be accepted to Northwestern. When her educational history consists of going to school at sea and studying at a ridiculously disreputable school like the Royal Tampa Academy of Dramatic Tricks, I find it hard to believe that Northwestern would take her. They are one of the more prestigious universities in the country. Nor does Jenna seem to be of outstanding intelligence or self-discipline.\n",

      "I normally don’t air out my gripes with writing like this, especially for a show as zany as this one. But even in the 30 Rock universe, it is very hard for me to imagine that Jenna would have been accepted into Northwestern. Unless the joke was to portray Northwestern as a poor school that will accept nearly anyone. I know it’s not a big deal; it just seems kind of absurdist even for 30 Rock!\n",

      "Hi! My name is Karen Konkoly and I'm a third-year PhD student in Ken Paller's cognitive neuroscience lab at Northwestern University. My projects focus on lucid dreaming and how it can be used to learn more about sleep, dreams, and consciousness more broadly.  I've been studying lucid dreaming for 7 years - since my sophomore year of college - when I attended an 8-day lucid dreaming retreat in Hawaii to garner ideas for my undergraduate senior thesis. (I subsequently concluded that the research was awesome.) The following summer, I worked at Brown University as a William E. Dement sleep research apprentice, and I gave a TEDx talk on lucid dreaming that fall. In my senior thesis, I taught participants to lucid dream in a month-long course, and I found that participants tended to feel less stressed and more vigorous the day after they had a lucid dream. After graduating from Lehigh, I interned at the Neuroscience and Psychology of Sleep lab at Cardiff University in Wales, assisting with an overnight project on presenting sounds during REM sleep. While in Wales, I also collaborated with researchers at nearby Swansea University to develop a new method of inducing lucid dreams. This method, dubbed Targeted Lucidity Reactivation, was able to induce lucid dreams in half of the participants in a single nap session. Now at Northwestern, I'm testing new methods and applications for communicating with dreamers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, Reddit! I'm Ken Paller, a Professor at Northwestern University, where I hold the James Padilla Chair in Arts & Sciences and serve as director of the training program in the neuroscience of human cognition. I'm a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, a Senior Fellow of the Mind and Life Institute, and was awarded the Senator Mark Hatfield Award from the Alzheimer's Association. My research has focused on human memory and consciousness - using a variety of methods including electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging - and my findings have contributed to understanding features of conscious memory experiences as well as ways in which memory operations differ in the absence of awareness of memory retrieval, as in implicit-memory priming, intuition, and implicit social bias. I've published nearly 200 scientific articles, reviews, and book chapters, some of which you can find on [my lab website](https://pallerlab.psych.northwestern.edu/). Some of my research has concerned patients with memory disorders, including evidence linking memory deficits to poor sleep. Recent studies from my lab showed that memory processing during sleep can reinforce prior learning, providing novel evidence on sleep's role in memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our [most recent paper](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00059-2) described innovative research on two-way communication during REM sleep. We demonstrated the feasibility of real-time dialogue between an experimenter and someone in the midst of a lucid dream. Experimenters asked questions for which the correct answer was known so that we could determine whether effective communication was achieved. When dreamers responded, their answers were given via eye movements or facial muscle twitches - and they were usually correct. The first successful two-way communication during sleep was achieved in the lab in the early morning of January 9th, 2019. Karen gave Christopher Mazurek, a research participant and now a member of the lab group, the math problem 8 minus 6, which Christopher answered correctly. (At the time, we were unaware of similar studies in Germany by Kris Appel and in France by Delphine Oudiette and colleagues. Later, we decided to publish our results together.) Further applications of this method, which NOVA PBS captured for the first time on film in a [digital documentary on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M06fJxiayo) and [wrote about in an article](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/lucid-dreaming-communication/), can now probe conscious dream experiences as they happen, and who knows what else!\n",

      "In this post I endeavor to eliminate these unoriginal names and replace them with fresh, unique names befitting each school's identity, history, and culture. Let's begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Tigers\n",
      "\n",
      "With 5 FBS teams (and numerous others in lower divisions), \"Tigers\" is the most popular nickname in the sport. Furthermore, three of these Tigers are in the SEC, making it the most urgent correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "* LSU Bayou Bengals\n",
      "* Auburn War Eagle\n",
      "   * These two are layups, as the LSU Tigers are already informally nicknamed the Bayou Bengals, and War Eagle is Auburn's battle cry. These programs won't need to change their identity, mascots, or really anything else. Total no-brainer.\n",
      "* Mizzou Zouaves\n",
      "   * Mizzou chose the name Tigers as a nod to the Civil War militia unit of the same nickname, which defended Columbia from the Confederates. In the same spirit, this nickname honors the 3rd Missouri Reserve Infantry Regiment \"Zouaves,\" which similarly defended the Columbia area from the rebel guerillas. Mizzou Zouaves kind of has a nice ring to it, I think. Mizzouaves!\n",
      "* Memphis Pharaohs\n",
      "   * The city of Memphis has a rich cultural history relating to food, music, civil rights, and more. But I decided to go another direction with this. Situated on the Mississippi, the city of Memphis was named after the ancient city along the Nile, making Pharaohs a unique and fitting team name.\n",
      "* Clemson Ruminants\n",
      "   * Unlike the other Tigers, which were named after Civil War units (LSU, Mizzou), lines from poetry (Auburn), or emerged organically from the student body (Memphis), \"Tigers\" was chosen by Walter Riggs, \"The Father of Clemson Football,\" because he wanted to be like Princeton and Auburn. So we're starting with a completely clean slate here. And unlike Memphis, Columbia, and others, there isn't much in the way of historical significance to draw inspiration from. But after exhaustive research, I found that the town is home to a certain site that appears on the National Register of Historic Places: The Clemson College Sheep Barn. Built in 1915, it is the oldest surviving agricultural building on campus. \"Ruminants\" are a suborder of hoofed herbivorous mammals, of which sheep are a member. This, combined with Riggs' proclivity for sheepishly copying other schools, make it the perfect team name.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Bulldogs\n",
      "\n",
      "FBS has 4 teams bearing the Bulldogs moniker, with two of them hailing from the SEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Mississippi State Maroons\n",
      "\n",
      "Another layup -- Mississippi State's original nickname was Aggies (unoriginal), then changed to Maroons in 1932. MSU was not officially named \"Bulldogs\" until 1961. FWIW, the school also had a lot of difficulty deciding what it should be called -- changing from The Agricultural and Mechanical College of the State of Mississippi to Mississippi State College and finally Mississippi State University. What a bunch of maroons!\n",
      "\n",
      "* Georgia Lumberjacks\n",
      "   * Founded in 1785, the first buildings on the University of Georgia campus were made from logs. The entire campus is designated an arboretum, and is home to thousands of trees of hundreds of varieties. Additionally, the town of Athens is home to The Tree That Owns Itself. \"Lumberjacks\" would be an ironic nickname, to be sure, but I wanted to select something that reflected the university's love of trees and forestry, and IMO Lumberjacks is way cooler sounding than Arborists.\n",
      "* Fresno State Matadors\n",
      "   * I struggled with this one a good bit. There wasn't much about the history or culture of Fresno or Fresno State that lends itself to becoming a team nickname. Presently, Fresno is one of the largest Hispanic-majority cities in the United States, so Matadors seemed a nice nod to the Hispanic community's impact on the history and culture of the area. Interestingly, there are no teams named Matadors in FBS, FCS, DII, or DIII.\n",
      "* Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters\n",
      "   * Louisiana Tech athletics already have two nicknames -- Bulldogs and Lady Techsters (basketball). With two NCAA championships and 10 Final Four appearances, the Lady Techsters are by far the most successful athletic program at LA Tech, making Lady Techsters the most appropriate name for all athletic teams at LA Tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Wildcats\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four wildcats in FBS, two of them are purple with a mascot named Willie. All of the names originate from some student or coach or journalist saying something about how the team \"fought like wildcats.\" It's like these people aren't even trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Arizona Sentinels\n",
      "   * The name of the city of Tuscon is derived from the Aztek word *Cuk Son,* meaning \"base of the black (hill),\" a reference to the hill now named Sentinel Peak. The hill bears a giant block \"A\" that was created by U of A students in 1916.\n",
      "* Kansas State Kingsmen\n",
      "   * Kansas State is one of only three schools (along with Syracuse and Harvard) that have only one official color - in this case, Royal Purple. In my research I was surprised to discover that there is a Major League Baseball team in Kansas City called the \"Royals,\" so that was out. But Kingsmen ties in nicely with the royalty theme, and who among us hasn't an affinity for alliteration?\n",
      "* Kentucky Colonels\n",
      "   * I mean, duh? This name has it all.  It's got alliteration. It's got natural NIL potential with the fried chicken chain. For those unaware, Kentucky Colonel is the highest honor bestowed by the state of Kentucky.\n",
      "   * Eastern Kentucky Moonshiners\n",
      "\n",
      "Turns out, EKU was already Colonels. But UK came first, and Moonshiners seems more appropriate for EKU given the area's history.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Northwestern Purple Haze\n",
      "   * Originally known as \"The Purple,\" the name was changed to Wildcats in 1924. In 1972 the student body voted to change the official nickname to Purple Haze, but they remained Wildcats nonetheless. Give the people what they want!\n",
      "\n",
      "# Eagles\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four teams named Eagles (if we include color modifiers), with two of them being members of the Sun Belt. The reasons each of these esteemed institutions of higher learning selected Eagles are about as thought-provoking as your average pickup truck commercial. \"Uh, how 'bout some freedom?? Yeah! \\[belch\\] Freedom! 'Merica!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "* Boston College Turkeys\n",
      "   * I almost gave BC a pass on using Eagles because of the city of Boston's role in the American Revolution. But the Bald Eagle as our country's official bird was chosen in Philadelphia, not Boston. So that won't do. But how about our country's second choice for official bird? According to legend, Benjamin Franklin preferred the turkey to the bald eagle, as the latter was \"a bird of bad moral character.\" Also something something first Thanksgiving.\n",
      "* Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Emus\n",
      "   * This change came from the suggestion box, and is superior to the name I had chosen. How I missed such an obvious choice, I do not know.\n",
      "* Georgia Southern Blue Tide\n",
      "   * What's up with these schools forsaking unique names for generic ones? Until 1959, Georgia Southern was the Blue Tide. They shall be the Blue Tide once more.\n",
      "* Southern Miss Normalites\n",
      "   * While reading about the history of Kansas State University, I couldn't help but admire the university's heritage as being only the second public college in the US to admit women and men equally, as well as admitting black students from the time it was founded in 1863. The school itself was established as part of an effort to keep Kansas a free state rather than a slave state. Reading about Southern Miss was a much different experience. For decades they were named the Confederates (*groan*) and their mascot was a literal KKK grand wizard (*holy fucking fuckballs)*. They fought against integration, even after Brown v Board of Education. When a Black Korean War veteran attempted to enroll, the university's president made considerable political efforts with the state government to block it. The would-be student continued to pursue an education at Southern Miss and was subsequently arrested and jailed for seven years on trumped up charges. The school's president is suspected to have been directly involved. Before becoming the Confederates in 1940 they were known as the Southern Miss Normalites. I don't feel like putting any effort into brainstorming a cool, creative name for them. So they can just be Normalites.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Aggies\n",
      "\n",
      "About a hundred schools started off as agricultural colleges and called themselves Aggies. The vast majority came to the wise conclusion that the name needed an upgrade. There are three FBS teams that abandoned reason for madness.\n",
      "\n",
      "* New Mexico State Outlaws\n",
      "   * New Mexico State is the Aggies, but their logo is a cowboy holding two pistols, and their mascot is notable cowboy Pistol Pete. It made no damn sense. Now it does.\n",
      "* Texas A&M Agricultists\n",
      "   * You all knew that was coming.\n",
      "* Utah State Highlanders\n",
      "   * In the 1960's there was a push on campus to replace Aggies with Highlanders, \"a nod to the university's historic ideological tie to Scotland, which came about very early on in the college's history\" and its setting in the mountains. Highlanders is a cool name. They kept the uncool name. The time has come to correct this error. No other FBS teams are named Highlanders. There can only be one.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Owls\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three Owls in FBS, two of which are in CUSA. A symbol of wisdom and intelligence, the majestic owl is a worthy choice for a university's team name. But we're talking about a sport where large men wear armor and bludgeon themselves into one another for 3 hours and risk significant brain damage. So perhaps not appropriate after all?\n",
      "\n",
      "* Florida Atlantic Airmen\n",
      "   * I'm a little sad to be taking Owls away from FAU. The campus was designated an owl sanctuary in 1971 because of the population of burrowing owls that live there. That's cool, I like that. But nobody gets a free pass here. Situated on a WWII era Army Air Corps' Airfield, Airmen is the next best thing.\n",
      "* Rice Immortals\n",
      "   * The first group of 59 students at Rice were known as the \"59 Immortals.\" Fuck, that's a cool name. Rice might be the biggest winner of this renaming thing.\n",
      "* Temple Bandicoots\n",
      "   * Temple originated as a night school, so the nocturnal owl was chosen to honor that heritage. The solution is as simple as it is elegant: Choose a different nocturnal animal. What better choice than the noble bandicoot? Other nocturnal creatures considered include the nightingale, Panamanian night monkey, red-eyed tree frog, slow loris, and galago bushbaby.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Panthers\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Panthers are native to this area and they're cool, so let's name our team Panthers.\" Fair enough, can't fault anybody there. But we simply can't have duplicates, so you're on the chopping block, same as everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Florida International Sunblazers\n",
      "   * I am fairly certain FIU let a class of kindergarteners name everything. Their team name is Panthers, and their mascot is named Roary. The name was changed from Sunblazers to Panthers in 1987, so maybe cocaine was involved. I don't know what the hell a Sunblazer is, but it does sound kind of cool.\n",
      "* Georgia State Ramblers\n",
      "   * Between 1947 and 1963, GSU teams went by the name \"Ramblers,\" although no reasoning for why has been presented. Whatever the case may be, Ramble On, Ramblers.\n",
      "* Pittsburgh Pumas\n",
      "   * Mountain Lions were once native to the Pittsburgh area, so the name Panthers was a natural choice for the alliteration and the animal's ferocity. Mountain Lions are also known as Pumas, so we get to check all the same boxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Huskies\n",
      "\n",
      "Huskies are beautiful dogs, but they shed too much. Now it's time to shed these unoriginal names.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Northern Illinois Generals\n",
      "   * I really couldn't find anything historically or culturally remarkable about DeKalb, Illinois or NIU. The town of DeKalb was named for American Revolutionary War hero General Joann de Kalb. General de Kalb, NIU salutes you.\n",
      "* UConn Malamutes\n",
      "   * Possibly apocryphal, the story goes that Huskies was chosen because of the UConn/Yukon homophone. So a different sled dog seemed appropriate. Enter the Alaskan Malamute. UConn wouldn't even need to change its logo.\n",
      "* Washington I's\n",
      "   * According to their website, \"the Husky was favored because it was easy to cartoon ... and is short and easy to use in newspaper headlines.\" I decided to keep their criteria. The letter \"I\" is even easier to draw, and what could be shorter to write than a single vertical line? Congratulations on the upgrade!\n",
      "\n",
      "# Wolverines\n",
      "\n",
      "Some names, while unique, are too revolting to remain. There is only one team named Wolverines.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Michigan Fighting Unicorn Sparkle\n",
      "   * For this one, rather than digging into the school or area's culture and history, I decided to let my daughters, aged 3 and 6, in on the action. I asked them if they could name a sports team anything they wanted, what would it be? Naturally, they said they love Buckeyes (proud daddy moment), but that's obviously taken. My six year old said the team should be the unicorns. My three year old chimed in, \"yeah, unicorn sparkles!\" The six year old disagreed, it should just be Unicorns, without the Sparkle. This resulted in a heated argument, which escalated into a fight (Michigan has a way of bringing out the worst in people, don't it?) So, I combined the three into what I believe to be the perfect name: Michigan Fighting Unicorn Sparkles. In a break from precedent on this list, their colors will also be changed to my daughters' favorite colors: Pink and Purple.\n",

      "**Two days before her disappearance.** [Tammy and her brother, Daren, road trip back to their respective universities from their home in New Jersey.](https://uncovered.com/cases/tammy-zywicki/timeline) They make a stop in Pittsburgh to visit family and then head to Evanston, Illinois, to drop off Daren at Northwestern. During the trip,they experience car trouble with Tammy’s white Pontiac, but they thought they had figured out the issue. Tammy and her brother arrive at Northwestern on August 22. Tammy stays the night with a friend, with plans to head out for Grinnell the next day. \n",
      "\n",
      "**The day of her disappearance.** The next morning, Daren checks her engine before she departs on the last leg of her trip. He reminds Tammy that if her car stalls, to pull over at a rest stop. Tammy does not even make it halfway on her journey west before car trouble appears to have befallen her again. More than 60 people report seeing Tammy looking under the hood of her car that day off the exit for Utica, IL. Reported tips to law enforcement suggest that 26 different cars pulled over to help her, but Tammy never arrives at Grinnell. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tammy’s parents wait for her to call and say she is fine, but that call never comes. With her parent’s constant urging, the police reluctantly begin to investigate her disappearance. Her car, which now had been towed, could not be tested for prints because of chain of custody failures. The only thing missing appeared to be her purse and her camera. There was no sign of a struggle. And at the time, law enforcement claims to have had several leads in Tammy’s case, but none resulted in an arrest. \n",
      "\n",
      "**8 days after Tammy goes missing.** A man is driving his pickup truck near Joplin, MO—500 miles from where she was last seen—when it begins to rain. He pulls to the side of Highway 44 to cover up the tools in the bed of his truck. Once out of the truck, he detects a foul order and notices a red Kenworth Truck Co. blanket wrapped in duct tape. Inside the red blanket was a female body wrapped in a white sheet—silver duct tape wrapped around both ends of the blanket. It was Tammy and she had been stabbed to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Today.** It's been nearly 30 years since Tammy disappeared from the side of the road and was murdered, and dumped the next state over. In that time, two leads have persisted in her case. First, multiple people have reported seeing a tractor-trailer on the side of the road with Tammy. The truck had two brownish-orange stripes on both the tractor and the trailer. Second, the man with the truck was approximately 6 feet tall with dark, bushy hair and estimated to be between 30-45 years old. It was also discovered that Tammy's Canon 35mm camera and a musical wrist watch with an umbrella on its face, that played a tune were missing from what was recovered from her car. \n",

      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Davante Richardson was 28 when he went missing from Washington D.C, USA.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "He was single and didn't have children, but he had a lot of other living family- parents, aunts, uncles and cousins, among others. Davante grew up with his mother in Washington D.C, but moved to Missouri at 13 to live with his father because he \"needed discipline\", and his father was in the military. He attended Lincoln University, where he studied fine arts, but he moved to Washington again before he gratuated. In 2020, Davante worked as a manager in a grocery store, which had closed during the pandemic. Davante later worked as an uber driver, but he contracted COVID shortly after.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Davante was very close with his mother, he lived with her at a home on Mississippi Avenue Southeast, and the two talked every day. Sadly, the Richardson family had suffered a loss before- Davante lost a sibling at some point in the past, which heavily impacted his mother. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "His biggest passion was music; Under the name D Rich, he described himself as the CEO of Big Blues Studio, a graphic design and multimedia company providing digital services for clientele in the music industry. Davante was a huge fan of Kanye West and he dreamed of becoming a music producer. He was also a tattoo artist, and loved to play basketball and football.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "According to Marquita Richardson, Davante's aunt, he \"(...) always been a laid-back type of person, quiet, always doing his own thing. He had friends, but not too many close ones. What he liked best was being in his room, listening to music\". \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Davante described himself by saing that he is \"a nice young man who wants to better himself in life. (He's) a Artist, Actor, Designer, Music Producer\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DISAPPEARANCE\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Davante's friend last had a contact with him on the 20th of July. Davante sent them a late-night text in which he claimed that he was going to start his music career, and that he planned to go visit his \"buddy\"- the world-famous rapper Kanye West. Davante had never met Kanye in real life, according to his loved ones, but he had expressed a desire to meet him in a now deleted youtube video. In the few days before he disappeared, his family didn't notice that anything was amiss, but his ex girlfriend said that Davante was \"depressed due to losing his job\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Davante was last seen in the Unit block of Mississippi Avenue, Southeast, on the 22nd of July, as he left his grandparents' home, and was reported missing on the 22nd. His family didn't realize he was missing for a few days; When they realized it, they called hospitals and jails, but there was no record of Davante anywhere. According to his mother, Davante left his clothes and musical equipment, but his tattooing equipment wasn't home.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Davante's car, a blue 2016 Jeep Compass with D.C. tags, was found on the 27th, 6 miles (9.7 km) east of the Greybull area of Wyoming, in Big Horn County, over 1,600 miles (2575 km) away from where he was last seen, but Davante himself wasn't located- the discovery of the vehicle was reported on the 29th. The car was abandoned on an off-the-beaten-path bentonite haul road used by two local mines. The road itself is unmaintained and unpaved, and there are no homes in the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) radius from the car; The nearest settlement is a town of Greybull, about 6-8 miles (9.7-13 km) away. The jeep wasn't damaged, but it was out of gas. Davante's laptop, keys, charger and 2 cellphones were found inside. The person who found the car claimed that there were no footprints leading away from it. Davante used his laptop to make music and do graphic design, so it was suspicious that he left it behind. His family says that Davante had never been in Wyoming and doesn't know the area.  \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "An alleged sigting of Davante took place on the 26th, on a gas station about 150 miles (241 km) south from where his vehicle was located. According to witnesses, Davante entered the passanger side of his jeep, while a white woman entered the driver's seat. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An investigator from Colorado was brought in to help with the searches, which involved drones and a helicopter, as well as people on horseback and on foot. Law enforcement is convinced that Davante wasn't in the 6 mile (9.7 km) radius around his car. A K9 sniffing dog was brought to help, but it failed to find Davante's scent. It was believed that Davante travelled through Nebraska, but new developments show that he actually went through the highline of South Dakota into Buffalo and through the Big Horn Mountains. Davante travelled non stop for over 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "It's believed that Davante wanted to reach Kanye West's ranch property, which was around 15-20 miles (25-32 km) away from where his car was found. The ranch itself is near Greybull. Police contacted West's team to ask if anyone had any contact with Davante, but they denied ever seeing or talking to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "The car was later processed by police, and a few red flags have been noticed by them; For example, the fact that the jeep was in a remarkably good condition for a vehicle that allegedly travelled the distance it did. The inside was also very clean, with a notable lack of fast food wrappers and similar clutter which tends to build up during a long roadtrip. No form of ID was found, and neither were Davante's clothes, a travel bag, wallet or any bank cards. There had been no bank activity on Davante's account ever since he disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I believe that Davante most likely became a victim of a manic episode or a similar form of mental breakdown. He had recently lost his job and was living on unemployment checks according to his mother, and caught COVID shortly after. The pandemic was already a difficult time on the psyches of many people due to isolation and fear of them or their loved ones getting sick, and it wouldn't be impossible that Davante was one of those people. The way he talked about Kanye West being \"his friend\" sets off alarms for me, especially since there's no proof that Davante and Kanye ever even met. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that he might've developed a delusion that Kanye was a personal friend who would help him jumpstart his music career; On impulse, Davante got into his car and drove to Wyoming to meet West on his ranch. People in manic episodes tend to make extreme decisions that they would never make outside of them, which is why Davante left without contacting his loved ones. The fact that there were no food wrappers, while potentially a red herring, could also be explained- people in manic episodes might forget about eating or drinking. That's also why he drove for over 24 hours- he was so determined to get to Wyoming that he simply didn't feel exhaustion or hunger. When he finally got to Greybull, he started to look for the ranch and took the road his car was found on. The jeep ran out of gas, so Davante went out to find a gas station or anyone who can help, got lost and perished; Perhaps his tiredness, hunger and dehydration negatively impacted his ability to navigate or judge his situation- so he left his electronics thinking that he will be back soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's possible that Davante got catfished by someone who claimed to be Kanye, but if that's the case, then this would have to be the worst catfishing attempt ever concieved, given that Davante's electronics and car weren't stolen and were just left on a road that was used, even if infrequently, in a place where a personal car would stick out like a sore thumb (since the only other cars that used it were transport trucks). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Davante's family believes that he wouldn't run away to start a new life, mostly due to his close relationship with his mother. From what we know about him, Davante was a calm homebody with a small group of friends who would rather stay at home and listen to music- hardly the kind of person who'd want to escape from some problems like debts, dangerous people or abusive family. He also had no children and wasn't in a relationship, so no responsibilities in that area of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a chance that Davante had met with foul play, but I think that's unlikely. Neither his car nor electronics were stolen, and I don't see why someone would attack him, other than due to a completely random desire for a thrill kill, which are exceptionally rare. I think that the sighting on the gas station isn't very credible- people often think that they saw a missing person and report it (usually with good intentions), but it more often than not proves to be someone else, so unless Davante was recorded with the woman or anyone else on something like a security camera, I wouldn't believe it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Kanye West was actually allegedly in his ranch in Wyoming in July. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "At the time of his disappearance, Davante Richardson was 28, making him about 32 now. He's Black, with black hair and brown eyes. He's 6'0\" to 6'1\" and 165 to 175 lbs. Davante has a mole on the right side of his face under his bottom lip, sleeve tattoos on both of his arms, and the word “BLUE” tattooed across his left knuckles. He was last seen wearing a blue shirt, gray sweatpants, multicolor new balance shoes, a blue durag, a brown/black bag with tattoo equipment and perscription sunglasses. \n",
